In C++, a variable is a named storage location in memory that holds a value that can be modified during the program's execution. Variables have a specific type that determines the kind of data they can store, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, or more complex types.

Here's a basic overview of variables in C++:

Declaration and Initialization: Variables must be declared before they can be used. Declaration involves specifying the variable's type and its name. Initialization means assigning an initial value to the variable at the time of declaration.

Copy code
int age;          // Declaration
age = 25;         // Initialization

int height = 180; // Declaration and initialization
Types of Variables:

Primitive Types: These include basic data types such as int, float, double, char, and bool.
Derived Types: These include arrays, pointers, references, and function types.
User-Defined Types: These include classes, structures (struct), unions, and enumerations (enum).
