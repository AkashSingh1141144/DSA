In C++, operators are special symbols or keywords that tell the compiler to perform specific mathematical, relational, or logical operations. Operators are categorized based on the number of operands they take, their functionality, and their use. Hereâ€™s an overview of the different types of operators in C++:

1. Arithmetic Operators
These operators are used to perform basic arithmetic operations.

+ : Addition
- : Subtraction
* : Multiplication
/ : Division
% : Modulus (remainder)
2. Relational Operators
These operators are used to compare two values.

== : Equal to
!= : Not equal to
> : Greater than
< : Less than
>= : Greater than or equal to
<= : Less than or equal to
3. Logical Operators
These operators are used to perform logical operations.

&& : Logical AND
|| : Logical OR
! : Logical NOT
4. Bitwise Operators
These operators are used to perform bit-level operations.

& : Bitwise AND
| : Bitwise OR
^ : Bitwise XOR
~ : Bitwise NOT
<< : Left shift
>> : Right shift
5. Assignment Operators
These operators are used to assign values to variables.

= : Assignment
+= : Add and assign
-= : Subtract and assign
*= : Multiply and assign
/= : Divide and assign
%= : Modulus and assign
&= : Bitwise AND and assign
|= : Bitwise OR and assign
^= : Bitwise XOR and assign
<<= : Left shift and assign
>>= : Right shift and assign
6. Increment and Decrement Operators
These operators are used to increment or decrement the value of a variable by 1.

++ : Increment
-- : Decrement
7. Conditional (Ternary) Operator
This operator is used to evaluate a condition and return one of two values.

? : : Conditional
